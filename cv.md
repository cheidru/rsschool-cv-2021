### About myself:
I've been interested in computers and programming fot many years. I worked as programmer for a short period. But it was long ago.  
Last years I've been working for a Swedish manufacturing company as an engineering manager. In this role, I was also responsible for different programs as administrator and key user.
Unfortunately, the company closed its production unit in Russia. And have time more time to contribute to my favourite area - programming.  
As to my **major traits**, I'm balanced and responsible. And I like to learn new things.

        private set(value) { 
            field = value.trim()
